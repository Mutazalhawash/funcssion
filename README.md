# funcssion

_The atomic CSS library._

**funcssion** is an opinionated set of CSS classes inspired by the philosophy behind [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).
This basically means, it _attempts_ to avoid side-effects.

Why _attempt_ you might ask? Well, because of the very nature of CSS, adding up properties or complex classes to an element, usually does not work as expected.

**funcssion** is just a set of _**really simple**_ CSS classes that'll do their best not to get in your way :)

Whether you're an experienced CSS coder or a total beginner, **funcssion** might always be always a good choice.

## Use it!
**v0.1 is out!** Minified CSS file is [available here](http://www.funcssion.com/css/funcssion.css)<br/>
Documentation will be available soon at **[www.funcssion.com](http://www.funcssion.com)**

## TODOs
- Documentation
- Request **funcssion** to be added to [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/)
- More _granular_ grid system? (Depending on screen breakpoints, like Bootstrap sm- md- etc.)

## Additional comments
I won't publish this as an npm module. And I _strongly_ encourage people not to do so either.<br/>
I'll rather publish this in [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) which, to me, is a more _responsible_ package manager than NPM.

This is a work in progress! Contributions (forks, issues, etc.) are more than welcome :)
