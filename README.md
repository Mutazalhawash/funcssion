# funcssion

_The atomic CSS library._

**funcssion** is a set of _really simple_ CSS classes inspired by the philosophy behind [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).
This basically means, they _attempt_ to avoid side-effects.

Why _attempt_ you might ask? Well, because of the very nature of CSS, adding up properties or complex classes to an element, usually does not work as expected.

Use of **funcssion** on top of other CSS libraries/frameworks is totally possible and even encouraged.

Whether you're an experienced CSS coder or a total beginner, **funcssion** is always a good choice!

## Use it!
**v0.1 is out!** Minified CSS file is [available here](http://www.funcssion.com/css/funcssion.css) (3.7kB gzipped)<br/>
Documentation is available at **[www.funcssion.com](http://www.funcssion.com)**

## TODOs
- Request **funcssion** to be added to [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/)
- More _granular_ grid system? (Depending on screen breakpoints, like Bootstrap sm- md- etc.)

## Additional comments
This is a work in progress! Contributions (forks, issues, etc.) are more than welcome :)
